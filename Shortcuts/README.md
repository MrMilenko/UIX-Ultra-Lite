## How-To: make shortcuts to titles on the F:\\ Drive for UIX Ultra Lite.

```
Shortcuts
|-- Apps

The following is an example to create a shortcut to the game "Fable" located at F:\\Games\\Fable. 
 
- Go to Shortcuts\\Games\\ create the folder names Fable
- Then in Shortcuts\\Games\\Fable\\ copy the shortcut file default.xbe that you extracted from the Shortcut.zip
- Next edit the default.cfg in your favorite text editor and put the path to the target .xbe file. i.e. F:\\Games\\Fable\\default.xbe
- Save the changes and copy the file to Shortcuts\\Games\\Fable\\
- Repeat the above for all of your F:\\ Drive titles.
- Once completed (if done on your computer upload the Shortcuts folder to E:\\ drive) restart UIX Ultra Lite and you title will show up in the Launcher Menu and can be launched.
